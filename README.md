# portfolio-website
Personal portfolio website

I found the template of this project for free online. It looked quite nice and gave me inspiration to adjust it to my needs. It uses an older version of Bootstrap (3) and therefore requires the Jquery Javascript library. Migrating the whole website to a newer version of Bootstrap, which no longer requires Jquery, is not necessary in my opinion, because it's only a simple website/portfolio. The Jquery library is lightweight and does not impact the performance too much.
